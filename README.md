🎨 Multimodal Generative AI Design Assistant (MVP)

This is an AI-assisted poster generation tool I’m building to explore how design logic and generative AI can work together. It takes text input and an AI-generated background and turns it into a usable poster layout using image processing and layout rules.

The focus of this project is on system integration and design intelligence, not training models from scratch.

✨ Features

- Text-based poster creation (title + subtitle)
- AI-generated background images (using Stable Diffusion)
- Automatic text placement using layout rules
- Downloadable poster output
- Simple web UI built with Streamlit

🏗️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Streamlit
- PIL (Pillow)
- Stable Diffusion (inference via Google Colab)

📌 Status

Working MVP. I’m currently improving typography, layout control, and overall design quality.

📎 Notes

This project uses pretrained models for inference only.
