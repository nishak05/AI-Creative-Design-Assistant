🎨 AI Creative Design Assistant (MVP)

This project is an AI-assisted poster design web application that helps users generate usable, readable poster layouts by applying design intelligence, image processing, and explainable layout rules.

The system focuses on design decision-making (layout, typography, contrast, and platform-aware rendering) rather than training models from scratch.

✨ Features

- Text-based poster creation (title + subtitle)
- Support for user-uploaded background images or curated samples
- Automatic text placement using layout rules
- Deterministic layout variants for design exploration
- Explainable design decisions (layout, font, color)
- Downloadable poster output
- Platform-specific exports:
    - Instagram
    - LinkedIn
    - YouTube
- Web-based UI built with Streamlit

🏗️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Streamlit
- PIL (Pillow)
- Stable Diffusion (inference via Google Colab)

📌 Status

Currently focused on improving usability, computer-vision–based layout intelligence, and design robustness.

📎 Notes

This project uses pretrained models for inference only.
